# Implementation of Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet Regularization for Predicting Car Price

## AIM:
To implement Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regularization models using polynomial features and pipelines to predict car price.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm

## Output:
![simple linear regression model for predicting the marks scored](sam.png)


## Result:
Thus, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regularization models were implemented successfully to predict the car price and the model's performance was evaluated using R² score and Mean Squared Error.
